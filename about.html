        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Design has been a fascination of mine ever since I went to Japan for the first time in 2006. Being one of the largest cities in the world, I appreciated the convenient lifestyle and attention to detail in everyday design. After studying abroad in Tokyo during my senior year of college and working in Japan for a year as an English teacher,  I moved back to my hometown of San Fransisco where I joined a Japanese mobile gaming and entertainment company as a visual novel producer. Seeing  how easily our users’ behavior fluctuated, I realized that I wanted to go beyond creating the content of the game. I wanted to learn how design could help both the business and the users.</p>
        <br></br><p>I view design as a way to create, learn, and improve our quality of life. From living in Japan, I realized that excellent design is essential for busy lifestyles. At a convenience store you can buy a meal, pay your bills, and purchase Disneyland tickets all in one place. If I were to choose my ideal city to live in, it would be San Fransokyo from Big Hero 6. I could imagine the combination of modern Japan’s real-world designs along with the San Francisco Bay Area’s digital designs would bring a little more joy to everyone.</p>
        <br></br><p>My ultimate goal is to help people utilize their time and effort efficiently. With my experience in mobile gaming, I understand that organization and flow are crucial in UX design. In order to build a good relationship between businesses and their customers, I strive to convey the business’ story and what they can provide for their users.</p>
