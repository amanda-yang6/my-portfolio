        <h1>BridgeCloud</h1>
        <p>BridgeCloud provides a space to save, share, and create your most important files.</p>

      <section><!--Problem and Solution-->
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>Through user research, I discovered that the cloud storage market is saturated with options that are difficult to use, are too expensive, or don’t offer enough space.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>I developed a tested clickable prototype which allows users enough storage to sync their devices to the cloud, and share their files with anyone.</p>
      </section>
      <section><!--Research-->
        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>I started with a survey and separated the users by which cloud service they used the most out of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. Nearly 87% of the participants said that preferred Google Drive over the other competition. Further, I found out that a large majority rarely or never use the commenting features in Google Drive, but they often used folders, shared their files, created content, and used the cloud as general storage.</p>

      <section><!--Competition-->
        <h1>Competition</h1>
        <p>Through conducting a competitive analysis, I found that storage plans separated the competition from each other. In addition, I analyzed user flows. Agreeing with the survey participants, useful features are often hidden in the UI of the competitors.</p>

      <section><!--Personas-->
        <h1>Personas</h1>
        <p>BridgeCloud users possess the following:</p>
        <ul class="personas">
          <lh>Goals</lh>
          <li>Save backups</li>
          <li>Share files</li>
          <li>Create files for assignments or projects</li>
          <lh>Frustrations</lh>
          <li>Difficult to share with non-account users</li>
          <li>Navigation is challenging</li>
        </ul>

      <section><!--User Stories + MVPs-->
        <h1>User Stories + MVPs</h1>
        <p>To meet the goals and solve the frustrations of the users, the MVP should have users be able to keep their files safe and create or add new files. The functions should include creating an account, uploading items from their device, and creating new items from the dashboard. Administrators should have access to users’ clouds and be able to unlock their accounts and recover any data that may be lost.</p>

      <section><!--User Flows-->
        <h1>User Flows</h1>
        <p>For my first iteration of the onboarding user flow, I attempted to create a sense of hierarchy and placed the information about the storage plans on a separate page from the homepage. However through user testing,</p>
        <p><b>I found that creating hierarchy by hiding information wasn’t the best for onboarding and teaching new users about the product.</b> </p>
        <p>I was able to put all the information about the business and the product on the homepage and make the user flow more simplified.</p>

      <section><!--Wireframes-->
        <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <p>For my first set of wireframes, I still had a very vague idea of what was going to work design-wise to help with onboarding. After feedback and more research, I came up with the final wireframes. Adding the login and purchase buttons to the top make it easier for returning users to login and find the purchase button.</p>

      <section><!--Testing Wireframes-->
        <h1>Testing Wireframes</h1>
        <p>During the usability test using just the wireframes, I found that users had a hard time understanding what product we were offering, so I wanted to make that information more easily visible.</p>

      <section><!--Branding-->
        <h1>Branding</h1>
        <p>When finding a direction for our branding, I started with mind mapping words associated with clouds, storage, and sharing.</p>
        <p>For the moodboard, I wanted to include curved lines similar to bridges. I chose blue as the main color to instill trust in the brand and orange to represent creativity and change.</p>

      <section><!--Logo-->
        <h1>Logo</h1>
        <p>After a few sketches, I decided on the more abstract and simple design for a more professional look and I didn’t want the image to overpower the name.</p>
        <p>The typography that I used in the logo is unique and bold to represent that a user’s account is filled with personal items. I paired this with a simple yet slightly rounded typeface to bring friendliness to the brand.</p>

      <section><!--Mockups + Prototypes-->
        <h1>Mockups + Prototypes</h1>
        <p>After testing my first prototype, I found that users prefer simpler images, so I moved forward with cleaner images for easier readability. Next, I utilized white space more efficiently and made the images compete even less with the text.</p>

      <section><!--User Testing-->
        <h1>User Testing</h1>
        <p>Testing the prototype, the participants didn’t have too much trouble with navigating the site, but I learned the importance of including microcopy.</p>

      <section><!--Conclusion-->
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>I began this project not knowing much about how we could create a product in an already saturated market. Research helped me greatly in identifying what features I would include, and how to differentiate this product from its competitors. BridgeCloud is designed for the well-being of its users where they can feel secure in storing and sharing their files easily.</p>
